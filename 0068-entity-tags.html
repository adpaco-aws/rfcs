<h2 id="summary"><a class="header" href="#summary">Summary</a></h2>
<p>This RFC proposes to extend the Cedar type system with the ability to include <em>embedded attribute maps</em> (EA-maps for short) in entity types, with the primary goal of supporting a full-featured encoding for <em>tags</em>. For evaluation purposes, EA-maps have the same programming interface as records: keys are like record attributes and values are like attribute values. The difference is in how they are validated: the keys of EA-maps need not be enumerated in advance, as is required with record attributes, and all values must have the same type. Moreover, EA-maps are treated by the validator as second-class, meaning valid usage scenarios are somewhat restricted.</p>
<p>The main body of this RFC proposes that EA-map keys must be <em>literals</em> when used to look up a key's value, just like record attributes, but Alternative A generalizes this proposal to allow keys to be dynamically computed. Alternative A thus adds expressive power but also implementation cost.</p>
<h3 id="basic-example"><a class="header" href="#basic-example">Basic example</a></h3>
<p>Here is a schema defining two entities, each of which contains embedded attribute maps (EA-maps, for short), used to implement tags.</p>
<pre><code>entity User = {
  jobLevel: Long,
  authTags: { ?: Set&lt;String&gt; },
};
entity Document = {
  owner: User,
  policyTags: { ?: Set&lt;String&gt; },
};
</code></pre>
<p>The <code>User</code> and <code>Document</code> entities each have an attribute of type <code>{ ?: Set&lt;String&gt; }</code>, an EA-map, implementing tags whose values are sets of strings. The syntax for EA-map types evokes a record, per the curly braces, but without named attributes; by providing just a <code>?</code> followed by a colon and a type, we indicate an unspecified number of optional attributes that have values of that type (here, <code>Set&lt;String&gt;</code>).</p>
<p>Here's a policy that conforms to this schema:</p>
<pre><code>permit (
  principal is User,
  action == Action::"writeDoc",
  resource is Document)
when {
  document.owner == principal ||
    (principal.jobLevel &gt; 6 &amp;&amp;
    resource.policyTags has "write" &amp;&amp;
    principal.authTags has "write" &amp;&amp;
    resource.policyTags["write"].containsAny(principal.authTags["write"]))
};
</code></pre>
<p>This policy states that for a <code>User</code> to carry out the <em>writeDoc</em> action on a <code>Document</code>, the user must own the document, or else the user's job level must be at least 6 and the document and the user must each have a <code>write</code> tag in their EA-maps, where at least one of the user's write-tag's values must be present in the document's write-tag's values.</p>
<h2 id="detailed-design"><a class="header" href="#detailed-design">Detailed design</a></h2>
<p>Neither the Cedar evaluator/authorizer, the JSON format for entities, nor the JSON or natural syntax for policies needs to change to support embedded attribute maps. This is because the notion of EA-map only arises at validation time, not evaluation time. At evaluation time, EA-maps are represented as records and support the same operations. In other words, for policy writers who do not use validation, there is no need for EA-maps: You can just use records. To support changes to the validator, the Cedar schema format, the validator, and the schema-based entity parser need to change to account for a new <code>{ ?: T }</code> type.</p>
<h3 id="schema"><a class="header" href="#schema">Schema</a></h3>
<p>EA-maps have type <code>{ ?: T }</code>, where <code>T</code> is the type of values. Only entity attributes can be given type <code>{ ?: T }</code>, and <code>T</code> cannot directly mention another EA-maps type.</p>
<p>We extend schemas as follows to support the new EA-maps type. Here's the natural syntax:</p>
<pre><code>Entity           := 'entity' Idents ['in' EntOrTyps] [['='] EntityRecType] ';'
EntityRecType    := '{' [EntityAttrDecls] '}'
EntityAttrDecls  := Name ['?'] ':' [Type | EAMapsType] [',' | ',' EntityAttrDecls]
EAMapsType       := '{' '?' ':' Type '}'
Type             := PRIMTYPE | Path | SetType | RecType
</code></pre>
<p>In essence: We alter the definition of entity types to include attributes with type <code>{ ?: T }</code>, where <code>T</code> is any type not mentioning another EA-maps type. Not shown here are the productions for <code>RecType</code> and <code>AttrDecls</code>, which apply to records rather than entities. These productions are unchanged---normal records may not include attributes with <code>{ ?: T }</code> types.</p>
<p>The JSON syntax for schemas specifies EA-maps as records with a <code>default</code> element, rather than an <code>attributes</code> element. Doing so leverages the analogy that EA-maps are like records in which all attributes are optional, with the same type. Here's our introductory example schema in this format:</p>
<pre><code>"entityTypes": {
    "User" : {
        "shape" : {
            "type" : "Record",
            "attributes" : {
                "jobLevel" : {
                    "type" : "Long"
                },
                "authTags" : {
                    "type" : "Record",
                    "default": {
                        "type" : "Set",
                        "element": { "type": "String" }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    },
    "Document" : {
        "shape" : {
            "type" : "Record",
            "attributes" : {
                "owner" : {
                    "type" : "Entity",
                    "name" : "User"
                },
                "policyTags" : {
                    "type" : "Record",
                    "default": {
                        "type" : "Set",
                        "element": { "type": "String" }
                    }
                }
            }
        }
    }
}
</code></pre>
<p>Legal schemas only allow records with <code>default</code> to appear as direct entity attributes, and likewise restricts the <code>type</code> associated with <code>default</code> to not include <code>default</code>-containing record types. Records with a <code>default</code> element cannot also have an <code>attributes</code> element (and so cannot have named attributes).</p>
<h3 id="policies-entities-and-evaluation"><a class="header" href="#policies-entities-and-evaluation">Policies, entities, and evaluation</a></h3>
<p>EA-maps support all of the same operations as records. Suppose that <code>E</code> is an expression of type <code>{ ?: T }</code>. Then expression <code>E has F</code> will check whether <code>E</code> has key <code>F</code>, evaluating to <code>true</code> if so and <code>false</code> otherwise. Expression <code>E.F</code> or <code>E["F"]</code> will retrieve the value associated with key <code>F</code> if <code>F</code> is present, signaling an error if it is not.</p>
<p>As a result, within the evaluator we can represent EA-maps as records, so the evaluator code does not need to change. In particular, EA-maps with keys <code>F1</code> ... <code>Fn</code> and associated values <code>V1</code> .. <code>Vn</code> are internally represented as records <code>{ F1: V1, ..., Fn: Vn }</code>. Similarly, EA-maps are represented as records in the JSON entity format. For example, here is entity representing <code>User::"Alice"</code> which conforms to our example schema:</p>
<pre><code>    {
        "uid": { "type": "User", "id": "alice" },
        "attrs": {
            "jobLevel": 5,
            "authTags": {
                "write": ["blue", "red"],
                "read": ["blue", "red", "green"]
            }
        },
        "parents": []
    }
</code></pre>
<p>Note that there is no way to represent a EA-maps <em>literal</em>. That is, you cannot write something like <code>{ write: ["blue", "red"]}</code> in a policy, like you might for a record literal. This is because EA-maps are always attached to entities, and entities themselves have no literal syntax.</p>
<h3 id="validating-policies"><a class="header" href="#validating-policies">Validating policies</a></h3>
<p>We extend the way the policy validator handles optional record attributes in order to support embedded attribute maps.</p>
<h4 id="capabilities"><a class="header" href="#capabilities">Capabilities</a></h4>
<p>Background: While typechecking an expression involving records or entities with optional attributes, the validator tracks <em>capabilities</em>. These represent the attribute-accessing expressions that are sure to succeed. If <code>principal</code> has type <code>User</code> and <code>User</code> has an optional <code>Boolean</code> attribute <code>sudo</code>, then the expression <code>principal.sudo</code> only validates if <code>principal.sudo</code> is present in the <em>current capability set</em>. Capabilities are added to that set by a preceding expression of the form <code>principal has sudo</code>, e.g., as in <code>principal has sudo &amp;&amp; principal.sudo</code>.</p>
<p>Capability tracking must be generalized to support EA-maps. In particular, an entity attribute of type <code>{ ?: T }</code> should be treated as a record with optional attributes, and <code>has</code> checks on its keys should update the capability set. For our introductory example, consider the following expression</p>
<pre><code>  resource.policyTags has "write" &amp;&amp; // (1)
  principal.authTags has "write" &amp;&amp;  // (2)
  resource.policyTags["write"].containsAny(principal.authTags["write"]) // (3)
</code></pre>
<p>After the subexpression (1), <code>resource.policyTags.write</code> should be added to the current capability set. After subexpression (2), <code>principal.authTags.write</code> should be added to it. Finally, when validating subexpression (3), the expression <code>resource.policyTags["write"]</code> will be considered valid since <code>resource.policyTags.write</code> is in the current capability set and it will be given type <code>Set&lt;String&gt;</code>, as <code>resource.policyTags</code> has type <code>{ ?: Set&lt;String&gt; }</code>. The expression <code>principal.authTags["write"]</code> is handled similarly. If either of the <code>has</code> subexpressions (1) or (2) were omitted, subexpression (3) would not validate due to the missing capability set entries.</p>
<h4 id="limited-operations"><a class="header" href="#limited-operations">Limited operations</a></h4>
<p>EA-maps' second-class status means that they can only be used as part of checking expressions <code>E has F</code> and projection expressions <code>E.F</code> or <code>E[F]</code>, where <code>E</code> has type <code>{ ?: T }</code>. The validator should disallow these expressions with type <code>{ ?: T }</code> in other contexts; e.g., the following should be disallowed:</p>
<pre><code>resource.policyTags == principal.authTags
[resource.policyTags, principal.authTags]
{foo: principal.authTags}
(if principal.isAdmin then principal.authTags else principal.authTags).write
</code></pre>
<p>(Note that the last case is disallowed because <code>principal.authTags</code> is not <em>directly</em> part of a <code>.</code> sub-expression -- it is returned from the <code>if</code> first. However, the usual short-circuiting mechanism would allow an <code>if</code> expression with a constant condition.)</p>
<h3 id="validating-and-parsing-entities"><a class="header" href="#validating-and-parsing-entities">Validating and parsing entities</a></h3>
<p>The Cedar authorizer's <code>is_authorized</code> function can be asked to validate that entities in a request are consistent with a provided schema. Extending validation to work with EA-maps is straightforward. The type rule is basically thus:</p>
<pre><code>v1: T ... vn: T
---------------------------------
{ f1: v1, ..., fn: vn } : { ?: T }
</code></pre>
<p>In particular, when asked to determine if a record has type <code>{ ?: T }</code>, we confirm that all values in the record have type <code>T</code>. By the nature of restrictions on schemas, the validator will only ever consider <code>{ ?: T }</code> types associated with entity attributes.</p>
<p>Similarly, schema-based parsing considers schemas when parsing in entities, and it can confirm when parsing that attributes labeled as <code>Record</code> in the JSON but defined as <code>{ ?: T }</code> in the schema have the appropriate shape.</p>
<h3 id="permissive-validation"><a class="header" href="#permissive-validation">Permissive Validation</a></h3>
<p>Permissive validation supports subtyping, which we extend so as to allow EA-maps' value types to be treated co-variantly:</p>
<pre><code>{ ?: T } &lt;: { ?: U }    iff T &lt;: U
</code></pre>
<p>We might consider adding rules that permit subtyping between records and EA-maps, but doing so introduces some complications with width subtyping. We could choose to grant EA-maps first-class status under permissive validation. For example, we could allow EA-maps values to appear anywhere, e.g., in <code>Set</code>s or records, and we could allow equality between EA-maps values. We choose not to do these things for now.</p>
<h2 id="drawbacks"><a class="header" href="#drawbacks">Drawbacks</a></h2>
<h3 id="non-dynamic-keys"><a class="header" href="#non-dynamic-keys">Non-dynamic keys</a></h3>
<p>EA-maps keys must be written in policies as literals. For example, you cannot write the following policy expression (using our example schema from above):</p>
<pre><code>principal.authTags has context.key &amp;&amp;
principal.authTags[context.key] == context.value
</code></pre>
<p>Supporting such <em>dynamic keys</em> is more work, but doable. With them, EA-maps would be strictly more powerful than existing encodings/workarounds for tags (the main use-case for EA-maps). We sketch the needed implementation work in Alternative A, below, and a comparison to workarounds further below.</p>
<h3 id="second-class-status"><a class="header" href="#second-class-status">Second-class status</a></h3>
<p>Only entity attributes are permitted to have type <code>{ ?: T }</code>, which eliminates the possibility of <code>{ ?: T }</code> literals and EA-maps directly containing other EA-maps. We also forbid using <code>==</code> and operations other than <code>has</code> and projection on <code>{ ?: T }</code>-typed expressions.</p>
<p>These restrictions are present for two reasons. First, second-class status ensures EA-maps are efficiently <em>analyzable</em>. Allowing first-class EA-maps values would require supporting equality between EA-maps values (directly or indirectly). Supporting equality would require a policy analysis to model EA-maps as arrays imbued with the extensionality axioms, which are known to be expensive. Second, second-class status means that we cannot introduce EA-maps literals, which means we do not need to introduce new syntax for EA-maps, which would be essentially the same as record literal syntax, leading to possible user confusion. Nor do we need to consider how we might treat record literals as equivalent to <code>{ ?: T }</code> values.</p>
<p>The use-cases that we are aware of do not suffer due to these limitations. If you wanted EA-maps to contain other EA-maps, or you wanted to store EA-maps in the <code>context</code> record, you can create specific entity types containing only those EA-maps. For example:</p>
<pre><code>entity User {
    roles: Set&lt;String&gt;,
    roleTags: { ?: StringTags },
};
entity StringTags {
    tags: { ?: String }
};
</code></pre>
<p>In effect, the <code>User</code>'s <code>roleTags</code> is equivalent to <code>{ ?: { ?: String } }</code>, but we have added a level of indirection by expressing the inner <code>{ ?: String }</code> value as an entity with a <code>{ ?: String }</code> attribute.</p>
<h3 id="implementation-effort"><a class="header" href="#implementation-effort">Implementation effort</a></h3>
<p>The implementation effort for adding EA-maps is non-trivial, as it will require changing the Rust code, the Lean models and proofs, and the differential test generators. It will also affect any component that leverages the schema and validator algorithms, such as schema-based parsing, and the policy analyzer.</p>
<p>That said, these changes are relatively straightforward:</p>
<ul>
<li>The validator changes are a straightforward extension to the handling of records with optional attributes. The extension to subtyping for permissive validation is also simple.</li>
<li>Changes to entity validation and schema-based parsing are fairly localized: They must consider the new EA-maps type when validating/parsing JSON <code>Record</code>-labeled entities.</li>
<li>The policy analyzer can model <code>{ ?: T }</code> attributes as uninterpreted functions because it never needs to consider equality between <code>{ ?: T }</code> values. Equality between entities is <em>nominal</em> -- we just consider the entity UID, not the contents of an entity's mapped-to attribute record (the only place that EA-maps can exist).</li>
<li>There are <em>no</em> changes to the evaluator or partial evaluator: From an evaluation perspective, <code>{ ?: T }</code> attributes are just attributes containing records whose attributes all have values of type <code>T</code>.</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="alternative-a-ea-maps-with-dynamic-keys"><a class="header" href="#alternative-a-ea-maps-with-dynamic-keys">Alternative A: EA-maps with dynamic keys</a></h3>
<p>Supporting dynamic keys (see "Drawbacks: Non-dynamic keys" above), requires a few extensions to the main proposal: to the policy grammar, evaluator (and partial evaluator), validator, and analysis.</p>
<h4 id="policy-grammar-and-evaluator"><a class="header" href="#policy-grammar-and-evaluator">Policy grammar and evaluator</a></h4>
<p>We change the <a href="https://docs.cedarpolicy.com/policies/syntax-grammar.html#relation">grammar for <code>has</code></a> so that the given attribute can be a <a href="https://docs.cedarpolicy.com/policies/syntax-grammar.html#member"><code>Member</code></a>, rather than an <code>IDENT</code>:</p>
<pre><code>Relation ::= ... | Add 'has' (Member | STR)
</code></pre>
<p>Here, if <code>Member</code> is just an identifier like <code>foo</code> then it is interpreted as a key name. Otherwise it is treated as an expression that should be evaluated to a string, which is the name of the key.</p>
<p>For completeness here is the current <code>Member</code> grammar:</p>
<pre><code>Member ::= Primary {Access}
Access ::= '.' IDENT ['(' [ExprList] ')'] | '[' STR ']'
Primary ::= LITERAL
           | VAR
           | Entity
           | ExtFun '(' [ExprList] ')'
           | '(' Expr ')'
           | '[' [ExprList] ']'
           | '{' [RecInits] '}'
</code></pre>
<p>We also change <a href="https://docs.cedarpolicy.com/policies/syntax-grammar.html#access">attribute access</a> to allow <code>Member</code> to appear within brackets. The semantics is that we evaluate <code>Member</code> to a string, and then use that string to access the attribute.</p>
<pre><code>Access ::= '.' IDENT ['(' [ExprList] ')'] | '[' STR ']' | '[' Member ']'
</code></pre>
<p>It may be that <code>Member</code> is a bit too expressive. If so, we may consider making key-computing expressions simpler, e.g., <code>foo.bar.baz</code>, and not <code>User::"foo".bar.baz</code> or <code>{ foo: "bar" }.foo</code>.</p>
<p>We can allow this extended syntax and evaluation semantics to apply to normal record and entity attributes as well. The validator will prevent it, however, so it will only be possible for non-validated policies.</p>
<h4 id="validator"><a class="header" href="#validator">Validator</a></h4>
<p>The validator must change to further extend capability tracking from what we've described above to include dynamically contructed attribute names. This should be straightforward. When the validator sees something like <code>principal.tags has resource.name</code> then this would generate the capability <code>principal.tags[resource.name]</code> that would allow a follow-on expression <code>principal.tags[resource.name]</code> to validate.</p>
<p>In addition, it's now possible that an attribute-constructing expression could access a bogus attribute, so those expressions must be validated as well. E.g., when validating <code>principal.tags has resource.name</code> or <code>principal.tags[resource.name]</code>, the validator must confirm that <code>resource</code> indeed has a <code>name</code> attribute.</p>
<p>Because expressions like <code>principal has context.name</code> are now grammatically legal, the validator must be updated to consider them fully. In partcular, the validator should only allow <code>F</code> to be an expression when writing <code>E has F</code> or <code>E[F]</code> if <code>E</code> has type <code>{ ?: T }</code>---it will not be allowed when <code>E</code> has a normal record or entity type.</p>
<h4 id="analysis"><a class="header" href="#analysis">Analysis</a></h4>
<p>The policy analyzer's logical encoding must be generalized to account for keys being specified as expressions rather than as literals. Because we are encoding EA-maps as uninterpreted functions, this presents no problem: it doesn't matter whether the key given to the function is a literal string or an expression that evaluates (is equivalent) to a string. That said, counterexample generation could be a little more involved.</p>
<h4 id="summary-1"><a class="header" href="#summary-1">Summary</a></h4>
<p>There is a tradeoff here. Alternative A is more work to implement than the RFC as given, but not significantly more. And it carries a significant benefit: It enables this notion of EA-maps to be strictly more expressive than both of the workarounds given below, which are modeling EA-maps as optional attributes, and modeling EA-maps as sets of key-value pairs. Anything you can do with either of those workarounds you can do with Alternative A. As a result, policy writers will be encouraged to always use EA-maps directly, which will be easier to manage for policy readers.</p>
<h3 id="alternative-b-open-records"><a class="header" href="#alternative-b-open-records">Alternative B: Open records</a></h3>
<p>Previously, <a href="https://github.com/cedar-policy/rfcs/pull/66">RFC 66</a> proposed <em>open records</em> as a generalization of records suitable for encoding tags. Open records are essentially the same as EA-maps, but they are less restrictive, conferring first-class status on values. However, and so they add far more complication to the implementation effort. See that RFC for further discussion.</p>
<h3 id="alternative-c-maps"><a class="header" href="#alternative-c-maps">Alternative C: Maps</a></h3>
<p>Another prior RFC, <a href="https://github.com/cedar-policy/rfcs/pull/27">RFC 27</a>, proposed to create <code>map&lt;T&gt;</code> types as alternative types for records whose attributes all have the same type <code>T</code>, and whose attributes can be dynamically constructed (like dynamic keys for Alternative A, above). That RFC's <code>map&lt;T&gt;</code> type is quite similar to this RFC's <code>{ ?: T }</code> type except that maps are not second-class, and support dynamic keys. Supporting maps would lead to even greater implementation challenges than open records, per discussion on both of those prior RFCs.</p>
<h3 id="alternative-d-different-syntax"><a class="header" href="#alternative-d-different-syntax">Alternative D: Different syntax</a></h3>
<p>Rather than give EA-maps the type <code>{ ?: T }</code>, we could give them the type <code>EMap&lt;T&gt;</code> instead. The drawback is that this type may more strongly suggest that EA-maps can be first class, though they are not. Similarly, we could give EA-maps the type <code>Map&lt;K,V&gt;</code> but require <code>K</code> to always have type <code>String</code>. Doing so may be disappointing to users in that <code>K</code> cannot be anything other than <code>String</code>, and (once again) <code>Map</code> values are not first-class. Both proposals fail to evoke the analogy with records, i.e., that EA-maps are a set of key/value pairs, with values all having the same type.</p>
<p>To avoid potential confusion we could give EA-maps type <code>{ T }</code> instead of <code>{ ?: T }</code>. The latter syntax could be confusing because <code>{ "?": T }</code> is already a legal type for a record with a required attribute <code>"?"</code> (thus allowing expressions like <code>context["?"] == resource.foo</code>). It might be surprising to users that surrounding <code>?</code> in quotes would change the meaning of the type, since types like <code>{ "name": Long }</code> and <code>{ name: Long }</code> are equivalent. Using syntax <code>{ T }</code> would eliminate the potential for a confused interpretation. Nevertheless, the potential for it already exists. Types <code>{ isPrivate?: Bool }</code> and <code>{ "isPrivate?": Bool }</code> are not the same: The former indicates an optional attribute <code>isPrivate</code> whereas the latter indicates a required attribute <code>"isPrivate?"</code>. Given this, we prefer syntax <code>{ ?: T }</code> since it more directly evokes that EA-maps are a kind of record with all-optional attributes, and is no more confusing than the status quo.</p>
<h3 id="workaround-records-with-optional-attributes"><a class="header" href="#workaround-records-with-optional-attributes">Workaround: Records with optional attributes</a></h3>
<p>We could avoid adding EA-maps entirely and work around their absence.</p>
<p>A direct workaround is to implement EA-maps as a record type that enumerates every legal tag as an optional attribute. Then, every time you create a policy that mentions a tag key as a literal, the validator will complain if that key is not in the schema. So, add the key to the schema, and the new policy will validate along with the old ones.</p>
<p>The drawback of this approach is that changing the schema on the fly to extend the list of valid keys could be expensive. If policies are being constructed on the fly, e.g., by a service's users, a schema update to support a new tag used by a new policy would technically require re-validating existing policies, whereas with EA-maps <code>{ ?: T }</code> we can leave the schema alone and avoid re-validation entirely.</p>
<p>Schemas are also simpler with <code>{ ?: T }</code> types, rather than a long list of optional attributes, and better communicate intent.</p>
<h3 id="workaround-tags-as-sets-of-keyvalue-pairs"><a class="header" href="#workaround-tags-as-sets-of-keyvalue-pairs">Workaround: Tags as sets of key/value pairs</a></h3>
<p>Another way to implement tags, rather than as EA-maps, is as sets of key-value pairs. For example, <code>principal.tags</code> could have type <code>Set&lt;{ key:String, value:String }&gt;</code> and a tag check would involve an expression like <code>principal.tags.contains({ key: "priority", value: "green" })</code>.</p>
<p>This approach has the benefit that keys can be dynamic. E.g., you can write</p>
<pre><code>principal.tags.contains(context.tagvalue)
</code></pre>
<p>where <code>context.tagvalue</code> can be dynamically determined. However, with this encoding of tags you cannot write expressions such as <code>resource.tags["project"] == principal.tags["project"]</code>
or
<code>resource.tags["projects"].contains(principal.tags["project"])</code>. We find this to be a strong limitation, as customers often want to exprss policies that relate the tags of principals to those of resources. Note that <a href="https://github.com/cedar-policy/rfcs/pull/21">RFC 21</a> would lift this limitation through the introduction of the <code>any?</code> and <code>all?</code> operators, but it was rejected due to problems with logically encoding these operators during policy analysis.</p>
